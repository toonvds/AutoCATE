**AutoCATE** is an open-source Python package for automated, end-to-end estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). Designed to simplify the complexities of causal inference, AutoCATE enables practitioners and researchers to quickly build robust ML pipelines for causal effect/heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in only *four lines of code*.

## ‚ú® Key Features
‚úîÔ∏è **Automated ML Pipelines**: Automatically builds pipelines and handles preprocessing, ML algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization.

‚úîÔ∏è **Custom Evaluation Protocols**: Incorporates different risk measures (e.g., DR-risk, T-risk) and risk metrics (e.g., AUQC) tailored for causal inference.

‚úîÔ∏è **Flexible Ensemble Methods**: Selects and combines the optimal pipelines for improved robustness and accuracy.

‚úîÔ∏è **Low-Code API**: Effortlessly predict treatment effects with minimal setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
AutoCATE operates in three stages:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluation**: Optimize the ML pipelines underlying the risk measure(s) (e.g., R-risk) for robust pipeline selection.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Estimation**: Optimizing ML pipelines for CATE estimation, combining preprocessors, metalearners, and baselearners. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ensembling**: Combines the top-performing pipelines to create a final model. 

## ‚ùì Why Choose AutoCATE?

Estimating causal effects requires dealing with **unique challenges** üö® 

  ‚ùå Evaluation is a challenge due to lack of ground truth CATE and covariate shift caused by confounding variables.

  ‚ùå Causal metalearners combine different ML algorithms and are complex to tune.

  ‚ùå No clear, established practices for preprocessing and ensembling.

AutoCATE eliminates these barriers by **automating the entire process**, making state-of-the-art CATE estimation accessible for everyone.

## üõ† Quick start

```python
from src.AutoCATE import AutoCATE

# Initialize AutoCATE
autocate = AutoCATE()

# Fit model on training data
autocate.fit(X_train, t_train, yf_train)

# Predict CATE for new data
cate_pred = autocate.predict(X_test)
```
